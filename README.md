# NinjaFan Catalog
Currently, Ninja Fan customers mostly come from platform e-commerce such as Shopee, Lazada and etc. This significant dependency to the big marketplace can be quite worrying. It is because ninja van will be significantly affected if they decide to stop choosing ninja van as their partner.

There are few initiatives by Ninja Van to try to obtain more non-platform shippers so as to reduce their dependency to big marketplace. One of them is a Ninja Biz mobile app that aims to streamline the processing of onboarding the shippers and sending of their parcels.

## Solution
In the spirit of increasing the number of non-platform shippers in Ninja van. We want to make an extension of the existing Ninja Van Biz mobile app to include a catalog feature.

Why catalog?

Provide integrated and seamless ordering service between the seller and buyer especially those who uses messaging platform such as Whatsapp only for most of their business transaction.
